### Virtualized Evolved Packet Core for LTE Networks (vEPC)

vEPC is a simple virtualized form of Long Term Evolution Evolved Packet Core (LTE EPC). It simulates the working of a typical EPC for handling signaling and data traffic. vEPC is developed in C++11. First opensource version (1.0) was released on June 10, 2016. A more advanced distributed LTE EPC implementation (v2.0) was released on 30th June 2017. vEPC version 3.0 is over netmap and mTCP (Kernel Bypass) built using non blocking sockets and was released on May 16 2018.

#### Synopsis

Network Function Virtualization (NFV) is a popular concept being proposed for redesigning various components in telecom networks. A bulk of NFV design proposals focus on EPC, which faces severe scalability and flexibility issues. This has set a new trend among network equipment manufacturing companies to build commercial implementations of vEPC. All such implementations try to achieve a highly scalable and flexible architecture to suit the needs of future mobile traffic. However, no complete open-source free vEPC exists to the best of our knowledge. Our code is a first step in this direction. Note that our code is not fully standards compliant, and is not intended for commercial use. Our code is intended for consumption by researchers to build and evaluate various NFV-based EPC architectures. The source contains a monolithic implementation of vEPC and a distributed implementation of vEPC.
